# Grading

**11/15**
Great work, your app works very well with the exception of a small bug when updating a submission. Your code is well orgainzed and consistently styled. The style of your app is thoughful and fits the theme of your project. Overall, very good job!

### Technical Requirements: Performing (2)

* App has a model that has full CRUD functionality!
* App is successfuly deployed to heroku

### Creativity/Interface: Performing (2)

* App has an easy to use interface and is thoughtfully styled
* Light and desaturated background image doesn't distract from page content
* Styled with materializeCSS

### Code Quality: Excelling (3)

* Code is well organized and shows separation of concerns

### Functionality: Performing (2)

* App is easy to use and navigate and has no major errors
* updating one part of a submission clears the other fields

### Planning/Precess/Submission: Performing (2)

* Great readme with description of app, functionality, resources and technologies used, and plans for future improvements
* ERD shows thoughtful planning
* Good use of frequent commits to track changes

### Additional notes:

* I've edited your `comic.hbs` view to suggest a way to prevent clearing the entire model when you update one part of a submission.
* It looks a bit off that your forms extend all the way to the right of the window. Consider adding a little margin on the right.
* A two column layout could look really nice to visually separate your forms from the rest of your page content
