    "review": "This issue is subtitled “The Origin of Bruce Wayne”. I feel like we know Bruce’s history and how Bruce became Batman, but this issue is about a boy whose parent’s were murdered, just like Bruce’s. It shows Bruce the path he could have taken, as this boy’s life mirrors Bruce’s in many ways. They are also adding to Batman's rogues gallery by introducing a new villain. Batman always has the best villains! I think it is a start to an interesting story I will be following."

    "review": "The final issue in the “Super Sons of Tomorrow” story. This is action packed and full of a lot of different characters. This issue features a standoff between the Teen Titans and the Titans of Tomorrow. Jon (Superboy) and Damien (Robin) are on the run and have humorous and brief battle with half of the Teen Titans when they find each other. Starfire, Aqualad, and Kid Flash decide they don’t want to hand Jon over to Savior (formerly know as Tim Drake), who wants to destroy Jon to prevent an event in the future that results in the death of millions. But Beast Boy and Raven aren’t on the same page as the other Teen Titans and want to capture and contain Jon. This issue kind of ends on a cliff hanger that is supposed to be resolved in an epilogue in 2 weeks in Super Sons issue 12."
