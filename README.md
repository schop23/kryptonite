# Weekly Kryptonite
It’s a bird… It’s a plane… It’s the comics you should read this week!

## Description
This application is a resource for people who love to read comic books, but don’t have time to figure out what they should be reading.  New comic books are released every Wednesday, this site will feature reviews of comic books, organized by release date, written by people who love comic books.  People who have the time to read comic books can come here and post reviews for people with busier schedules. It eliminates the need for busy people to search through various sources to figure out what good comics were released in a particular week, it will all be organized in one place.

## List of Features
I believe my project, in its current state, is Performing based on our rubric.  There is CRUD functionality implemented with RESTful routes and semantically-clean HTML and CSS.  It was built using Express, Handlebars, and Mongoose.  I have at least one non-User-model.  It has been deployed on Heroku. Users can add a comic book with it’s information and a review for it.  They can also edit that entry and then delete it if they want. 

## List of Technologies
Express, Handlebars, Mongoose, MongoDB, NodeJS, JavaScript, JSON, Materialize, CSS, HTML, MLab, Heroku, and Quicktime were all used to complete this project.

## Installation Instructions
This project can be viewed in your browser by going to the website: https://weekly-kryptonite.herokuapp.com/

## Contributions / Aspirations
In the future I am looking to adding more dates.  I would really like to add the ability to add “upvoting” to the individual comics so the best comics for a selected date can be moved to the top of the stack so that they are the ones other users see first.  I would love any suggestions about implementing that, as it is something I have never attempted.  I also want to add user sign-up and sign-in with authentication.
